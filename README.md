# Patrick Bradley's Portfolio

## Introduction
I was approached to develop and deploy Mr.Bradley's portfolio once he was done redesigning i.
<br>
My deadline was 4 weeks, starting from Friday, October 9th. The tools I used could be anything, as long as it was
<br>
WCAG compliant, deployable via Heroku, easy to manipulate later on, and filled with comments.

---------------------------

## Development Principles
The limitations for the development were very minimal, only requiring to replicate the design laid out in the documents.
<br>
Because of this, I chose a tech-stack that I was comfortable with to get the best results, while also experimenting with new features.
<br>
Some things I knew I wanted to do when going into this site: Fetch data from a DB, and create dynamic links with content without requiring a full page load.
<br>
Create an environment that was easily editable for anyone else that would come in to make changes, and create insanely fast load speeds regardless of content.

---------------------------

## Tech
The software stack I used was: JavaScript, Vue, PHP, and SASS. I chose this stack due to comfort, and knowing exactly how to work with fetching data 
<br>
and file structure. This allowed for me to rapidly develop this nearly completely dynamic site in around 2 1/2 weeks, with a deadline of 4.
<br>
The way Vue is used is not used as the actual base. I used JavaScript as the catalyst, and Vue through it to generate the content, which allowed for PHP.
<br>
PHP is essentially just used as a database loader, content fetching and some error handling, nothing special but easily implemented.
<br>
With SASS, I used a lot of nesting and clean file structure, making is much easier for anyone, including the owner to jump in and edit with little knowledge of CSS.
